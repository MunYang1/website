<h1>My first heading</h1>
<p>By writing "&lth1&gtMy first heading/&lth1&gt" it generates the heading above. The center allignment is done within the style section. <!A comment is being made here to show that I can make a comment in the text editor without it appearing on the webpage></p>
<h2>My second heading where I insert an image</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/691996376766218291/824632058063224832/PepeHands.png" alt="PepeHands" style="width:128px;height:128px;">
<p>Picture is shown by &img src="URL LINK" alt="NAME" style="width=128px;height;128px;">. I will use &ltbr&gt to break the sentence abrup<br>ly <br>src is the source of the image, where an URL link of the image is shown, I did this by copying the link of the image from discord (an online messenger)
<br>alt will provide a name for the picture, in the case that the image link doesn't work, it will display an empty image as well as the name set in the alt to describe to the viewer what the image was meant to be.
<br>style will read from the style section that was set at the top of this html, which will keep to it's original resolution
</p>
<p>Here is an unordered list, where I will use &ltul&gt to define unordered list and any items for the list will be done in separate lines with &ltli&gt:
<ul>
<li>item 1
<li>item 2
<li>item 3
<li>item 4
</ul>
</p>
<p>Now here is an ordered list which is done by using &ltol&gt instead, and any items are set by &ltli&gt:
<ol>
<li>item 1
<li>item 2
<li>item 3
<li>item 4
</ol>
</p>
<p>
I can also set the starting number for an ordered list by defining &ltol start="ANY NUMBER"&gt I will use 50 for this case
<ol start="50">
<li>item 1
<li>item 2
<li>item 3
<li>item 4
</ol>
</p>
<h3>
Now here is an example of a hyperlink, where a link is embeded onto a piece of text <br> Click <a href="page2.html">Page 2</a>this</a> link below to find out how it is done!
